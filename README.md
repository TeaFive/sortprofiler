# Sortprofiler
SortProfiler is a C++ [command-line] tool for benchmarking sorting algorithms, built as an exploration of algorithm analysis and a simulation for basic telemetry. Currently, it defaults to running a single test (Bubble Sort with 10,000 elements), prints runtime results to the terminal, and generates a human-readable log file.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This is a personal project created for learning and experimentation, not intended as a practical tool. Development is currently paused while I focus on academics, with occasional updates when time permits. For the most up-to-date progress and roadmap, please refer to the [`cli-implementation`](https://github.com/TeaFive/sortprofiler/tree/cli-implementation) branch.
